/*
FACTORY METHOD PATTERN
🎯Purpose
"Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate"
📊 When to Use

✅ When you don't know exact types beforehand
✅ When creation logic is complex
✅ When you want to delegate instantiation to subclasses
✅ When you need to support different product families

⚠️ When NOT to Use

❌ If creation is simple (just use 'new')
❌ If you only have one concrete class
❌ Over-engineering for simple scenarios
