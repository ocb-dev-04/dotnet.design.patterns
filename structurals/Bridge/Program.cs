/*
BRIDGE PATTERN
🎯 Purpose
"To decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently"
📊 When to Use

✅ To avoid class proliferation (combinatorial explosion)
✅ Abstraction and implementation can vary independently
✅ Changes in implementation do not affect clients
✅ Share implementation among multiple abstractions

⚠️ When NOT to Use

❌ If you only have one dimension of variation
❌ If abstraction and implementation are tightly coupled by nature
